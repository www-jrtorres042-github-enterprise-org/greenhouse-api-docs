When submitting a job application, you will use the <code>id</code> field to specify the application's target job post.

Returns a job post. Setting the questions querystring parameter to
`"true"` will include the list of job application fields; these fields
can be used to dynamically construct your own job application form.

Any job custom fields you have selected to be exposed in the job board API will be shown in the `metadata` attribute.

### HTTP Request

`GET https://api.greenhouse.io/v1/boards/{board_token}/jobs/{job_id}`

### URL Parameters

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
board_token | Job Board URL token
job_id | ID of the office to retrieve

### Querystring Parameters

Parameter | Description
--------- | -----------
questions | *(optional)* If set to `true`, include the list of job application fields.  

### Questions

Possible field types:

| Type | How to represent |
|------|------------------|
| input_file | Represent with an input of type file |
| input_text | Represent with an input of type text |
| input_hidden | Represent with an input of type hidden |
| textarea | Represent with a textarea |
| multi_value_single_select | Can be represented as either a set of radio buttons or a select
| multi_value_multi_select | Can be represented as either a set of checkboxes or a multi-select

Please note that it is possible for multiple fields to be aggregated beneath a single question. The "Resume" field is a prime example, with both an input_file and textarea type accepted. If marked as required, then we expect at least one of these fields to contain a valid value when your form is submitted to the [application submission](#applications) endpoint.

### Location questions

When questions=true is passed, we add a "questions" list to our response, but
we also include another list: location_questions.

If a job post has "Location" set to "Hidden", this list will be empty.  If
"Location" has been set to "optional" or "required", this list will be populated
with three question objects (in the same format as the questions found in the
normal "questions" section of our response). These include "location",
"latitude", and "longitude".

Location is a text field that should be exposed to the applicant (as indicated
by its input_file type).  Latitude and Longitude should not be exposed to the
applicant (as indicated by their input_hidden type).  Latitude and Longitude should
be Numbers that indicate the given location's coordinates.

Here is the suggested workflow for populating "latitude" and "longitude":

1. The applicant begins typing a location in your "Location" text box.
2. As the applicant types, your app makes a call to the [Google Places Autocomplete API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places-autocomplete)
to retrieve suggested location names (e.g. New York, NY, United States)
and their associated place_ids (e.g. ChIJOwg_06VPwokRYv534QaPC8g).
3. Display the suggested location names to the applicant.
4. The user selects a suggested location.
5. Use the place_id from the previous API call to retrieve latitude and
longitude information for the selected location [using the Google Place Details API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places#place_details).
6. Populate your hidden "latitude" and "longitude" fields with the result of
this API call.

When submitting location through the API, all 3 fields must be included.  E.g.
if only "location" is sent ("latitude" and "longitude" are omitted), we will
ignore "location" entirely.
