EXAMPLE FORM BELOW (simplified):

Please keep in mind that the HTTP Basic Auth API token is a secret key.  Any form posts should be proxied by your own servers.  Any direct post to the /applications POST method would reveal your secret key to anybody that views source--which would be a very bad thing.

Use this endpoint to submit a new application. This endpoint accepts a multipart form POST representing a job application. Application forms are job-specific and will be constructed via the "questions" array available via the [Job method](#retrieve-a-job). Please see the [Job method](#retrieve-a-job) documentation for instructions on submitting location information through the API.

Note that when submitting an application through this method, Greenhouse will not confirm the inclusion of required fields. Validation for required fields must be done on the client side, as Greenhouse will not reject applications that are missing required fields.

<aside class="warning">
  This method requires HTTP Basic Auth over SSL/TLS: the Basic Auth username is your API key (found on the API Credentials page). No password is required.

<aside class="notice">
  In general, we would encourage customers to make use of the Embedded Job Application before going to the trouble of building their own form. Our application form is well tested, validated, battle-hardened, and has built-in spam protection measures. Building your own form can introduce a number of challenges which are typically not worth the additional effort.

### Collecting Applicant Location

Here is the suggested workflow for populating `location`, `latitude` and `longitude`:

1. The applicant begins typing a location in your `location` text box.
2. As the applicant types, your app makes a call to the [Google Places Autocomplete API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places-autocomplete)
to retrieve suggested location names (e.g. New York, NY, United States)
and the `place_id` associated with each location (e.g. `ChIJOwg_06VPwokRYv534QaPC8g`).
3. Your app displays the suggested location names to the applicant.
4. The applicant selects a suggested location.
5. Your app uses the `place_id` from the previous API call to retrieve the latitude and
longitude for the selected location using the [Google Place Details API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/places#place_details).
6. Your app populates the hidden `latitude` and `longitude` fields with the result of
this API call.

Note that all 3 fields must be included. If only `location` is sent and `latitude` and `longitude` are omitted, `location` will be ignored entirely.
