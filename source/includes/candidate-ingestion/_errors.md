# Errors

## Error Codes

> The response body will contain a JSON payload with the following form:

```json
{
	“errors”: [
	{
		“message”: “<String>”, “field”: “<String>”
	}
	]
}
```

Successful API responses will have a 200-level HTTP status code. Greenhouse reserves the right to add fields but will not remove or rename fields. If there is a problem processing your request, you will receive a response with a 4xx- or 5xx-level status code as follows:

Status Code  | Description 
-------------- | -------------- 
400 | Your request included invalid JSON.
401 | You have not been authenticated.
403 | You have been authenticated, but your Greenhouse user does not have permission to the resource.
404 | The resource you requested could not be found.
5xx | There was an error on our end. You may retry at a later time or contact support if the problem persists.
