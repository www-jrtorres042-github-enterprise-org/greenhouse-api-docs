# Tracking Links

Tracking Links are URLs which allow users to track the source and/or referrer of candidates who applied through the link. Greenhouse generates Tracking Links by appending a token to the end of a job post or job boad URL. These tokens represent a combination of source_id and/or referrer_id, and can link back to a job post, job board, or job.
